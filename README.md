I’m a Principal Engineer at Cisco Systems with 17+ years building large-scale AI, cloud security, and digital adoption platforms. I architected Cisco’s AI Support Fabric (CDAP • Shepherd • Agentic AI Assistant) — the in-product intelligence framework driving proactive diagnostics, agentic workflows, and real-time customer experience automation across Cisco’s security portfolio.

My expertise spans AI security, agentic systems, secure LLM architectures, edge-deployed intelligence, cloud reliability, and telemetry-driven automation. I focus on designing AI that strengthens enterprise resiliency, accelerates troubleshooting, and enhances in-product user experience at global scale.
